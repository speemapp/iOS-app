# SPEEM iOS app

## :warning: :construction: Under Active Development :construction: :warning:

The SPEEM project is still in early stages and very much a work in progress. More features will be added,
docs may be missing or outdated and api/config may change.

This is the SPEEM native iOS app. It contains native code (Swift/SwiftUI) that handles the UI/UX part, it also contains a compiled version of the SPEEM Core shared library for the business logic.
